My English name is John Lee and my Korean name is Lee SooHwan.

I was born in Gainesville, Florida, and spent most of my childhood in Seoul, South Korea, and Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. I attended Benicia High School in a quiet town called Benicia, which is located in the Bay Area.

I am currently attending University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign as a double major in Mathematics and Statistics.

This blog is my way of motivating myself to understand statistics more accurately and more in-depth, code, learn and practice statistical models, and ultimately become a better statistician by conveying these ideas in my own way to an imaginary audience.

When some coding is necessary, whether it is to manipulate data or run some models, I will use R and include the code in the posts.

If, by some serendipity, you happen to stumble across this tiny blog, and if you have some feedback for me and my blog, I will gladly listen to them. Feel free to email me at <theghks2@gmail.com>.
